Exercise for the course TDT4240 at NTNU.
# Task 1 - Sprites
Not much to say about this one. In the beginning of the development I had problems with connecting to my phone, and thus did all the development for task 1, 2 and 3 for desktop and somewhat the emulator. When I finally figured out what was the problem I found it a bit . This task should work correctly on mobile, but it's scaled with very small sprites.
