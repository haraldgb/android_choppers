# android_choppers
Exercise for the course TDT4240 at NTNU.
# Task 3 - Animation, timing, and collision detection.
Not a lot to say about this one really. Like mentioned below, on a high resolution phone / emulator it's not as interesting to see the helicopters fly for a long distance before meeting the others.
In the beginning of the development I had problems with connecting to my phone, and thus did all the development for task 1, 2 and 3 for desktop and somewhat the emulator. When I finally figured out what was the problem I found it a bit . This task should work correctly on mobile, but it's scaled with very small textures.
