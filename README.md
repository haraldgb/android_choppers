Exercise for the course TDT4240 at NTNU.
# Task 2 - Input and text
The program prints the position of the left bottom corner, and the prints below the y position is the input values used for debugging. I made the helicopter move towards the input as long as it was within screen, stopping at the edges. I did this by making a vector towards the input and scaling it to not have a velocity higher than four in total.
In the beginning of the development I had problems with connecting to my phone, and thus did all the development for task 1, 2 and 3 for desktop and somewhat the emulator. When I finally figured out what was the problem I found it a bit . This task should work correctly on mobile, but it's scaled with very small textures.
